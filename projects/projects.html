            <li><h3 class="project-title">This Website!</h3><br>
                <p class="project-desc">To make this website function I needed to utilize the web browser's local storage so that you can choose and save any color scheme that you would like. Additionaly, I had to link to a main root css file that hold the default color scheme just in case you want to change it back!</p>
            </li>

            <li><h3 class="project-title">Python LAN Chat</h3><br>
                <p class="project-desc">Using python's built in socket library, I made a terminal run application that allows people to communicate within a local network.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="project-desc">I learned a ton abou TCP connection protocal, and how servers handle clients and send data</p>
            </li>

            <li><h3 class="project-title">Json Parsing Library in C</h3><br>
                <p class="project-desc">I am currently working on a C library that can parse json data. This project utilizes dynamic memory allocation and the string library to read the json file and output values that a user might want.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="project-desc">While it is not quite finished yet, I have made a header file for this library so anyone who downloads the files can access the function by including the header file.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h3 class="project-title">DoorBot</h3><br>
                <p class="project-desc">The basic idea of this project is that it will make knowing when the lab is open much easier. Everytime someone opens the door a discord bot will tell the COSI discord server that the lab has been opened up.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="project-desc">This project has gotten me more familiar with using API'S, namely the Discord python API. It is very nearly done, all it needs is a switch hooked up to a pi.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h3 class="project-title">File Manager Application</h3><br>
                <p class="project-desc">This Project is one of the largest that I've done on my own, it is mostly completed with more than 400 lines of C. Essentially it is a simple application that finds really old files on your computer and gives you the option to delete them if they are no longer useful to you. Additionally, it has a user interface that is made with GTK 3.0 and CSS</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have been making this project both at the request of my girlfriend and because I wanted to get more familiar with the C programming language.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Making this application has made me really enjoy writing C, and I currently consider it my favorite programming language ðŸ˜Ž</p>
